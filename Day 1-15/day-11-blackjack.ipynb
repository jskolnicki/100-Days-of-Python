    "\n",
    "#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input \n",
    "#and returns the score. \n",
    "#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.\n",

    "#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.\n",
