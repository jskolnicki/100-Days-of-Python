<h1>Jared's Top 3 Books</h1>
<h2>Top 3 books since he started reading every day</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>1. Shoe Dog</h3>
<p>This book kept me captivated the whole time and I could relate well to Mr. Knight's mindset.</p>
<br/>
<h3>2. Be A Real Estate Millionaire</h3>
<p>This one started out a little weak, but picked up on the third part. So much so that I could not keep up with it. The man grinds there's no doubt about that. Real estate has many ways where you can gain an edge on people (according to him, while still creating win-wins for both sides).</p>
<br/>
<h3>3. Modern Romance</h3>
<p>This one cracked the top 3 because it was relatable and helps understand the complexity of the dating world due to the rapid changes of technology. Dating is not the same today as it was for our parents. <br/>It is no longer about
    finding someone that is "good enough" because the entire world of people seems available at the palm of your hands. However, it is also not that easy and can be much harder to deal with. My theories are that it greatly depends on which type of person we are talking about. If it's a 10/10 model, then of course she is going to have a million options and will likely not find love on the app. Same with a man who seems to have it all (i say seems because what shows on the outside is often just for show but it is hard to find the person on the inside).
    <br/>Most dates don't even get to the second or third because of so many options that it makes the person feel the need to wow them right away. But getting to truly know someone takes much more than one date, and relationships are being missed because of that.
    <br/>Passionate love seems to last about 12-24 months, and after that, compassionate love takes over [or doesn't I suppose]. This is the love that lasts a long time and continues to grow over many years [withouttrying to sound too pessimistic, this is what he claims. is this some sort of way of saying that love doesn't exist?]
