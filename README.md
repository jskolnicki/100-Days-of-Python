# 100-Days-of-Python
My progress throughout the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp on Udemy by Angela Yu

This course is designed to provide a foundational understanding of Python. I realize it's easy to get away with copying and pasting solutions that the videos give so, to challenge myself, I add my own little twist to many of the coding challenges along the way.

Examples include:

Day 11 - Adding a rolling bank account so that you can play a real blackjack game
Day 22 - Adding a custom photo as the pong ball and speeding up the game as it goes (Pong)
Day 23 - Creating a "cheat code" to move to the next level automatically (Frogger)
Day 24 - Not dying in the snake game when it hits the edge (Snake game)
Day 28 - Making my own Pomodoro timer with my friend Pat's NFT
Day 28 - Creating my own tool to count the number of times that my coworker David and I say the word "dammit" (dammits.py)
Day 31 - Not using the timer aspect of flashcards and instead adding a flip card button. Designate a name at beginning so that multiple people can save their progress
Day 32 - Took the same concept into the workplace. Having Goggins motivational quotes sent to the #team-closers channel in Slack
